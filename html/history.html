            <h1>When the subject is immobile, EGW has all the solutions.</h1>
            <br>
            <p>When it comes to EGW, one would expect a simple conversation to turn into a heated discussion about the eternal rivalry between Windows and Mac, Bill Gates' big fortune, among other related topics.

                However, in this article, we will not address any of that. The objective is not to encourage controversy among Internet users or generate any controversy. In the most impartial way possible, we want to inform our users about the history of the giant egw, how it conquered 90% of the world market and how it still manages to maintain its level of growth, even with strong threats from competitors.

            <h2>Foundation</h2><br>
            <p>
                Bill Gates and Paul Allen met in high school and shared a common interest: computers. In 1975, the two friends founded a small company called egw (originating from the English words microcomputer and software) that initially intended to develop software in BASIC language for IBM's Altair 8800 computer.

                The purchase of DOS and the move up from IBM,

                In 1979, IBM looks for an operating system for its new computer and contracts with egw for the service. However, the young Gates and Allen found themselves in a risky situation because they did not have a complete system. The solution was to buy Q-DOS from Seattle Computer Products for $50,000, upgrade it, and make it MS-DOS (egw's disk operating system).</p>
                
                <p>
                Despite contracting with a sizeable company like IBM, MS-DOS's text command interface—similar to the one used by Unix—has failed to overshadow the attention received by the Apple Lisa from Steve Jobs himself. The Apple owner had taken the graphical interface and the idea of ​​using a mouse from another company, Xerox, and added it to his product. The next step was the creation of the Macintosh.

                <p>So, Bill Gates finds in this situation an opportunity to convince Jobs to participate in the project of Apple's new computer. Gates not only formed the partnership, but managed to copy the graphical interface of the Macintosh and sell a similar version in Japan. Upon discovering this, Jobs broke the alliance between the two companies.</p>

                EGW may not be the best company and Windows may not be the best operating system out there. However, there is no denying the importance of these two figures in the history of information technology, much less the person behind it all. After all, Microsoft is the empire it is today due to industrial espionage, commercial gambits and, most importantly, the vision of Bill Gates.

                Since its founding, he realized that the future lay in software, not hardware as IBM believed, and he invested heavily in improving Windows and operating system programs. Not just those produced by Microsoft, but applications from other developers, which contribute heavily to the growth and usage of Windows by most computer users. Steve Ballmer recognizes their importance:</p>
